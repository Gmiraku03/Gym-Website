    <h2>With a Masters degree in strength and conditioning from Oxford University, Shaun left university and went into a bodybuilding career. He followed that with a semi-professional rugby career and more recently focused on personal training. He supports a number of clients, notably those in a rugby arena from his performance gym and has a huge presence of social media. But despite this level of influence, he encourages aspiring trainers to focus their energy into what’s important to them. He reminds them that an online following isn’t necessary to have a profoundly important impact on someone’s life and to double down on those things that you’re good at and that make you happy.

    <h1>Matt Roberts</h1><section>
        <h2>
            London based trainer Matt trains a roster of celebrity clients, is a published author and has his own brand of fitness clothing. But despite this borderline celebrity trainer status, he remains grounded. He knows that working with regular people and helping them to achieve the results they’re looking for is what gets referrals, and word of mouth business. After 23 years of experience in the fitness industry, Matt knows something about being able to relate to others and considers interpersonal skills to be one of the most important assets an aspiring trainer can possess.
